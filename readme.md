# networkmanager [![build status](https://gitlab.it.liu.se/pm-liuit/networkmanager/badges/production/build.svg)](https://gitlab.it.liu.se/pm-liuit/networkmanager/commits/production)

## Description

Start with a one- or two-sentence summary of what the module does
and/or what problem it solves. This is your 30-second elevator pitch
for your module. Consider including OS/Puppet version it works with.

You can give more descriptive information in a second paragraph. This
paragraph should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?"
and "Why would I use it?" If your module has a range of functionality
(installation, configuration, management, et cetera), this is the time
to mention it.

## Setup

### What networkmanager affects **OPTIONAL**

If it's obvious what your module touches, you can skip this section.
For example, folks can probably figure out that your mysql_instance
module affects their MySQL instances.

If there's more that they should know about, though, this is the place
to mention:

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module
  will alter, impact, or execute.
* Dependencies that your module automatically installs.
* Warnings or other important notices.


### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync
enabled, et cetera), mention it here.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires
particular steps for upgrading, you might want to include an
additional "Upgrading" section here.


## Usage

This section is where you describe how to customize, configure, and do
the fancy stuff with your module here. It's especially helpful if you
include usage examples and code samples for doing things with your
module.


## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, et
cetera. If there are Known Issues, you might want to include them
under their own heading here.
